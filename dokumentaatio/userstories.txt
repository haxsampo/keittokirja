I want to be able to look for recipes which are fairly easy so that if my non-cooking friends ask for easy recipes I can easily provide them.

I want to be able to pull information directly from websites so that the information is saved in a more or less useful fashion, so that if I see an interesting recipe I can easily save it for later, without checking my browser for saved interesting recipes.
